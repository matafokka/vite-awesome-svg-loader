`SvgIcon` is a wrapper around `SvgImage` that simplifies working with icons by providing:

1. Props and CSS variables to control icon size, color and transition.
1. Default HTML attributes for the icons.

It is still required to [configure](/loader-api-reference/interfaces/svgloaderoptions) `vite-awesome-svg-loader`
to use the needed [transformations](/guides/available-transformations).
Make sure to check out `vite.config.ts` file in the demo's files below.
