  SVG symbols provide a way to customize images that doesn't hurt performance as much as putting SVGs
  directly into the DOM. See [main article](./guides/svg-loading-methods) for the details.

`SvgImage` component renders SVG source code into an SVG symbol, so you'll have more freedom to manipulate it.
Most importantly, it allows you to set custom colors.

This example also introduces `vite-awesome-svg-loader`
[configuration](./loader-api-reference/interfaces/svgloaderoptions). Make sure to check out `vite.config.ts` file in
the demo's files below.
