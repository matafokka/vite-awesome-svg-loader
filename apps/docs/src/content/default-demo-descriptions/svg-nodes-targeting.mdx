All IDs and classes of every SVG elements are prefixed with a unique string to avoid collisions.
If you need this prefix, you can extract it like so:

```ts
import imageSrc, { prefix: imagePrefix } from "@/image.svg";
```

This works with any import method.

One of the purposes of this is targeting SVG elements in scripts or styles.

The demo below changes element's colors when user clicks on it. Each element has its own color map.
This is implemented via accessing by a class name.
