**[vite-svg-loader](https://github.com/jpkleemans/vite-svg-loader)**

Implements a portion `vite-awesome-svg-loader` functionality. This loader can also import SVGs as Vue components.

Due to framework-agnostic nature of `vite-awesome-svg-loader` and relative simplicity of outputting raw HTML, this task is delegated to the user, and can be done as easy as you would with [vite-svg-loader](https://github.com/jpkleemans/vite-svg-loader) for example:

```vue
<template>
  <div v-html="imageSrc" />
</template>

<script lang="ts" setup>
import imageSrc from "./path/to/image.svg";
</script>
```

Similar approach can be applied to any other framework or vanilla JS.
