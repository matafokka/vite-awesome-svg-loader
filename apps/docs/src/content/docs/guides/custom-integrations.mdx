1. Import helper functions and styles:

```ts
import "integration-utils/styles.css";

// There function will run only on client side. However, they won't break SSR.

import {
  onSrcUpdate, // Should be called when component is mounted, and source code is updated
  onUnmount, // Should be called when component is unmounted
} from "integration-utils";
```

2. Write your integration. Use [vue-integration](https://github.com/matafokka/vite-awesome-svg-loader/tree/main/packages/vue-integration) as an example.

3. Please, submit your integration in a PR. Or just create an issue and provide the source code if you don't have time
   or don't want to deal with this project's development process.
