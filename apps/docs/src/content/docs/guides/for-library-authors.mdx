If your icon set is not extensible, just add `vite-awesome-svg-loader` and build your library.

If your icon set is extensible, you'll need to:

1. Provide a plugin that wraps `vite-awesome-svg-loader` and sets your settings.
1. Tell your users to use your plugin, import icons as source code and pass it to your components.

Check out [urlImportsInLibraryMode](/loader-api-reference/interfaces/svgloaderoptions/#urlimportsinlibrarymode) option if you're importing files as URLs.
