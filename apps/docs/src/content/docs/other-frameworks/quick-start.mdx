You can integrate `vite-awesome-svg-loader` with any framework by using `vite-awesome-svg-loader/integration-utils`
package. It provides two main functions:

1. [onSrcUpdate](/other-frameworks/api-reference/functions/onsrcupdate/) - should be called when component is mounted, or source code is updated
1. [onUnmount](/other-frameworks/api-reference/functions/onunmount/) - should be called when component is unmounted

<Aside>
  See [API reference](/other-frameworks/api-reference/) for all available symbols
