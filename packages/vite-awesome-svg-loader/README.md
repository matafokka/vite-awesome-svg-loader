# vite-awesome-svg-loader

This package bundles all other packages together. In other words, it acts like a meta-package.
`dist` directory is the final library bundle.

Entries, configs, and exports inside `package.json` are auto-generated.

`tsdown` is used as a bundler because only it was able to correctly bundle types at the moment of writing this text.
